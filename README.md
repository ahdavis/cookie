Open-source Chip-8 emulator

# Usage

First, install the app via the Snap Store or by installing the Snap package
contained in the Releases tab on the repository homepage. It can also be
installed by entering `sudo snap install --edge cookie` in your terminal.

Run the app via Terminal or your chosen program manager. It will display a 
file chooser dialog allowing you to select a ROM file. Your ROM must have
the file extension `c8` or `C8` to be able to select it. Three sample ROM
files are located in the repository, and more are available online.

## Controls

The emulator uses a sixteen-key hex controller. This is accomplished 
through the 1-4, Q-R, A-F, and Z-V keys on your keyboard. The 1 key 
corresponds to button `0`, and the V key corresponds to button `F`.
